# Aerospace Performance Calculator

## A fully functional aerospace calculator written in Python and HTML/CSS!

This Web App accepts user inputs such as fuel capacity, payload, thrust, etc and generates performance indicators by calculating input variables. The Aerospace Performance Calculator is designed to:

* Calculate rocket, missile, or aircraft performance metrics based on user input.
* Incorporate formulas for range, endurance, fuel consumption, and climb performance.
* Allow users to specify rocket/aircraft characteristics such as weight, wing area, and engine thrust.
* Provide graphical outputs and analysis of performance trade-offs.
