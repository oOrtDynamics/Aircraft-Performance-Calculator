# Rocket Performance Calculator

## A fully functional aerospace calculator written in Python and HTML/CSS, linked with PyScript!

This Web App accepts user inputs such as fuel capacity, payload, thrust, etc and generates performance indicators by calculating input variables. The Rocket Performance Calculator is designed to:

* Calculate rocket, missile, or aircraft performance metrics based on user input.
* Incorporate formulas for range, endurance, fuel consumption, and climb performance.
* Allow users to specify rocket/aircraft characteristics such as weight, wing area, and engine thrust.
* Provide graphical outputs and analysis of performance trade-offs.
